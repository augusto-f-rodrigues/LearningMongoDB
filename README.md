# Nodejs integration with MongoDB
## Libraries
- express
- express-handlebars
- mongodb
- nodemon
- dotenv

## Objective
In this project my objective is learn more about [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/pt-br) integration with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
I'll try use the MVC architecture too.
To do the pages [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) help for a more clean structure.

## How works
This project have a home page to list all previous created products at the collection products in my mongoDB server and a page which has a form to create a new product, it's not testable because the password and other things are in my [environment variables](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), but you can see how works through the gif's bellow
